## 4. Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path Tasks

The critical path represents the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum project duration:

1. **Foundation Setup** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Environment setup → Database schema → Models → Authentication

2. **Core Development** (Weeks 3-6)
   - Service layer → Controllers → Frontend foundation

3. **CMS Development** (Weeks 7-9)
   - CMS features → Admin panel completion

4. **Frontend Development** (Weeks 10-12)
   - Page templates → Component integration

5. **Content Migration** (Weeks 13-15)
   - Content extraction → Transformation → Import

6. **SEO and Performance** (Weeks 16-17)
   - SEO implementation → Performance optimization

7. **Testing** (Weeks 19-20)
   - All testing phases → Bug fixes

8. **Deployment** (Weeks 21-22)
   - Environment setup → Deployment → Launch

### Critical Path Duration: 22 weeks

### Tasks with Float (Non-Critical)

Tasks that can be delayed without affecting project completion:
- **AI Chatbot Integration** (Week 18): Can be done in parallel with testing preparation
- **Some CMS features**: Can be developed in parallel with frontend
- **Documentation**: Can be done throughout project
